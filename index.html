    <section id="about" class="section about">
      <h2 class="section-title">About</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p class="about-lead">Mohana is a deeply technical builder with a bias for action and a get-things-done mindset.</p>
        <p>She specializes in data engineering, analytics, automation, and agentic AI—not just making data useful, but making it think. She's built dashboards; she's also built agents that build dashboards. With an M.S. in Data Science and a B.S. in Computer Science, she thrives in high-trust, high-pressure environments where execution is everything.</p>
        <p>She doesn't wait for instructions. She takes ownership, aligns fast, and focuses on what's being built together—bringing high ambition, fast iterations, and long-term thinking. Her work spans B2B and B2C across travel, education, fitness, and SaaS.</p>
        <p><strong>Life story.</strong> Entrepreneurship has always felt natural. Her dad's an entrepreneur; many of her friends are too. She's drawn to people who build things from scratch and take bold risks. She doesn't wait around for permission and makes high-risk decisions with confidence—once leaving a job without a backup plan and landing three offers in two weeks. When she wants something, she goes after it aggressively and figures it out along the way. That drive is what led her here.</p>
        <p>She advises and consults for early-stage companies—including El Camino (women-led travel)—and has freelanced long-term for 3+ startups across travel, fitness, and ed. Her network is deeply in the startup world: friends across founding, raising, and building.</p>
        <p>Committed to the tech community, she's an active instructor and mentor—Code First Girls (EMEA), WISE (Women in Software Engineering), Developer Circles from Facebook. Outside of work: Pilates, healthy eating, travel, analyzing human behavior like a part-time psychologist, and the occasional binge-watch.</p>

            <p class="link-preview-desc">Worked from 32 cities across 9 states—based in San Francisco. The only one in her close circle who didn't go through a major life change this year, and yet the year felt full: baby showers, friends moving across startups and raising funding, dad's new venture and nonprofit crossing 8k, sister planning a move to Germany. Simple but intentional days—early mornings, Pilates and gym, finishing Meditations. Growth is not always loud; sometimes it's consistency, resilience, and showing up. Grateful for Wand AI.</p>

        <p class="building-lead">I’m drawn to building and to hackathons—especially those that encourage women in tech. Thinking of an idea, designing a revenue model, exploring the market plan, and analyzing cost dependencies is what it’s all about.</p>

          <blockquote class="building-quote">
            <p>There’s no magic formula, but there are repeatable patterns. Successful founders can answer: Who is in pain? How often? What happens if they don’t fix it? They start painfully narrow. Not big revenues early—but someone pays, someone renews, someone complains when it breaks. That’s the strongest signal.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="building-quote">
            <p>Successful startups have founders who can survive stress together. Many great ideas die because the team collapses first. Survivors don’t rely on hope.</p>
